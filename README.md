**AI-assisted Software Builder | Custom SaaS & Automation**

I design and build custom software systems with a focus on **clarity, deployability, and client control**.  
My work combines system design and human judgment with AI-assisted implementation to deliver production-ready software efficiently.

I work solo and also take on freelance and contract projects.

## What I Deliver

- Full **source code ownership**
- **Dockerfiles and docker-compose** included
- Deployable on **client-owned infrastructure**
- No vendor lock-in
- Clear project structure and basic documentation

You receive the complete codebase, not a hosted black box.

## Areas of Work

- Multi-tenant SaaS applications  
- Internal tools and automation  
- Education platforms (quizzes, question banks, payments)  
- Software licensing and DRM-style systems

## Infrastructure & Deployment

| Area | Tools / Approach |
|-----|------------------|
| Containerization | Docker, docker-compose |
| Servers | Self-managed VPS |
| Internet Exposure | Cloudflare Tunnel |
| Reverse Proxy | NGINX, Caddy |
| HTTPS | Managed via Cloudflare |
| Databases | PostgreSQL, MariaDB |
| Caching / Queues | Redis (basic usage) |
| CI | GitHub Actions |
| Deployment Model | Client-owned infrastructure |

## How I Work

1. Clarify requirements and constraints  
2. Design system architecture  
3. Use AI for implementation under direct guidance  
4. Review and debug logic manually  
5. Deliver source code with Docker configuration  
6. Support deployment and iteration  

The goal is software that can be **understood, maintained, and controlled** by its owner.

## AI-Assisted Development

AI is used as an implementation tool, not as a decision maker.  
Architecture, constraints, and correctness are defined by me.

This approach reduces development time while maintaining:
- system structure
- maintainability
- deployment reliability
